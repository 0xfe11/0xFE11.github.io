2017 have been an interesting year for myself, it is the first time that I considered doing something other than games. In the past, I always thought that I would graduate and be involved in a game company. However in recent months, I have been exposed to building softwares that are not related to video games and I really enjoyed myself building these applications that I have considered to devote myself to building software instead of video games after I graduate.

In these past few months, I am interning as a software developer. My primary role includes building web backend for them using technologies like flask, mySQL, MongoDB. Apart from them, I am also exposed to a machine learning project that is undergoing where we learnt and used SciKit-Learn to implement a model. 

Recently, I went for an interview and I was given a task to do. The task include using Gmail API to get mail and download and encrypt the mail onto the folder. I decided to go with the Google C++ client API which is dated and a pain to get it to work. I will discuss about how to get it to work.

Happy New Year to everybody. I will kick start this year with a posts regarding what I want to do in this year and for the many years
to come. 2016 had been an eventful year for me, I learnt to build my own game (engine) from scratch, and I learnt numerous stuff like embedding
mono and DLL reloading.

This year, I am hoping to learn more about the graphics pipeline and currently I am working on my own renderer based on
OpenGL. There are a few things on my todo list, like learning Rust, Vulkan, making my own Text Editor, Compiler, the latter two hopefully in the
near future.

In this post I will talk briefly about what I am working on, namely my own GL renderer for my own game engine. I am creating another game engine
from scratch, hopefully enough to prototype my next game idea. I have a rough idea of how my new game will be like. I am thinking of making a top
down multiplayer game. The game would be fast paced competitive and cartoony. I will prototype out the game idea hopefully in the next couple of
weeks.

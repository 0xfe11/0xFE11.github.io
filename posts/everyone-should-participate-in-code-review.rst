Hi everyone, this is another one of the rants that I have at my workplace. Currently I am interning at a software company and I get to participate in
developing the company's software. At our company, the workflow is usually this, someone will create a ticket on our Jira and it will be assigned to
an engineer to work on. When an engineer finished implementing the code, they will push it into their own forks of code into git and submit a pull request
to merge into the mainline.

Wait a minute there, I said submit a pull request. Yes, so when we submit a pull request, we have to have at least 1 engineer do a code review before we
are allowed to merge into the mainline. Whenever a junior engineer or an intern like me commit any change and submit a pull request, we have to let our 
team lead do a code review. This is nice and all to prevent us from accidentally committing bad code (that do not follow guidelines) into the main line.

The thing that have been bugging me is this, junior engineers have to be code reviewed but what about the team lead themselves? Do they get code reviews? 
Even if they do, I feel like as a junior engineer or intern (like me) can also play a part in the code review process. We can pose questions as to why the
lead made certain decisions. The way I see it, the junior engineers commit takes a long time because it is always under review until we resolve whatever issues
it is the reviewer have with the code, while the leads themselves can commit anytime they want. I believe everyone should go through code reviews whether they are
junior, senior or even the leads themselves.

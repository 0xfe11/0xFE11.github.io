Seriously why are web browser using so much memory nowadays, how much ram do I need before my web browser run out of memory to operate. I am
running Firefox browser v77.0.1 (latest stable). I have in the browser 15 opened tabs, some of them pinned (like my messengers) and memory
usage is about 1GB?!? On my current machine, I have a 8GB ram initially but I realized after some light web surfing and usage, the memory
usage climb to about full utilization. Seriously what is my web browser doing?! Ended up I had to upgrade my ram so that I can open more tabs.
I will try to see if it is something wrong with firefox, maybe it is time for a refresh.

Or maybe it is time to switch to something else entirely. Seriously I dislike the bloat that is the web. It is filled with javascript that is
really slow to execute and on top of that, those ads filled piece of malware on most website is really making my computer doing unnecessary work.
I hope we can use the web without all this bloat. I wish there is something I can do about it.

End of my rant about bloated web and web browsers.

It's coming to an end for 2018. In the beginning I set down some of the things I would like to achieve. Let's take a look
at the list.

    - Be proficient in Linux, switch to using Linux full time. âœ”  
       Not full time, however I use it on the weekends.
    - Learn and write some programs in Rust. âœ– 
       Although, this hasn't happen, I wrote a few programs in D.
    - At least one post per month for this blog. âœ”
       More than 12 posts in the past year. ðŸ˜€
    - Learn at least 3 new language this year (Rust/Go/Pascal/Dart/Red). âœ”
       In fact I am learning D and Nim, Java.
    - Develop a cross platform mobile app of any sort. âœ–
       I am learning Flutter at the moment. 
    - Join a game jam. âœ–
       Didn't happen due to work commitment, will try again next year.  
    - Learn Vim properly. âœ”
       I am re learning neovim again. Also thanks to OniVim's tutorial. 

I think I am actually quite proud of myself. The goals I set out to achieve this year, I have managed to cross a few
off the list. Again, 2018 have been a really fullfilling year. Have a happy holidays and a happy new year.

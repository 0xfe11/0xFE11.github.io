One year has passed since I started this blog, There are a lot of things that I learn, which I wrote in previous posts. There are much more that I would like to learn in terms of programming. 

This year I would like to try something different. I will list down the things that I would like to achieve. 

In no particular order:
    - Be proficient in Linux, switch to using Linux full time.
    - Learn and write some programs in Rust
    - At least one post per month for this blog.
    - Learn at least 3 new language this year (Rust/Go/Pascal/Dart/Red)
    - Develop a cross platform mobile app of any sort.
    - Join a game jam
    - Learn Vim properly

I will keep the list short for now, I will update this list monthly to see if any goals were achieved. Hopefully by the end of the year, I will all of these striked off.

To kickstart the year, I am currently learning Rust/Object Pascal at the same time. I have not thought about the projects I would like to do with these two projects. Maybe I would develop some sort of patcher/updater tool.

I am currently writing this blog post in my old Linux box with Vim. Hopefully, I get to do this more often.

More to come!

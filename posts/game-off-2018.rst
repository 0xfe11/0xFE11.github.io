Hi everyone, for those who are not familiar with game jams, it is basically a short period of time where participants are given a theme to work
on something fun. 

The theme of this jam_ is Hybrid. I am still thinking of an idea. Hopefully I can get something tonight. As for the tools, I will be
using RayLib_. 

I really like the idea of a minimal framework to make my game. Also I am more comfortable using C/C++ for my game. We will see where this goes.
I will be working on this on weekday nights and weekends (hopefully) with my commitment to work. 

Come back and see the game 1 month later. Happy Jamming!!

Update: I was caught up in work and I procrastinated a little. I will try to do a proper game jam next time. Maybe those
short ones.

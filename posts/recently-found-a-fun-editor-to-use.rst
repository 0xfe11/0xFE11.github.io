Recently while I was looking to install neovim on my Manjaro Linux, I found this editor named Howl. I thought the icon looks really interesting and I decided to install it.

After I installed, I had forgotten entirely about its existence until recently when I was looking through my installed apps and I found it. So what is this Howl Editor. Based on the website, it is a keyboard-centric editor that is built on LuaJit and fully programmable. Sounds very interesting.

In my mind I was wondering if this was another Vim/Kakoune editor of some sort with weird keyboard shortcuts. I have not use Kakoune yet but I thought it looks somewhat like that.

Anyhow, I opened the editor and started typing. It just allows me to type. Well it is not a modal editor, I am still somewhat learning my Vim. Over the years, I have tried Vim/Emacs but I always have so much trouble with it. Howl on the other hand feels really easy to learn. It has a lot of nice features and I really feel like it has a lot of potential.

One thing I wish it had was native support for Windows. Currently I have seen people trying to build on Windows but with some minor issue. It is a little pity in my opinion.

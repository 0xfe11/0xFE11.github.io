Looking back on 2020, these are some of the things I have done.

   1. `Created a scraper for the page 3DBuzz`_
   2. `Installed arch on my old Lenovo`_
   3. `Decided to try out FreeBSD`_
   4. `Joined my first CTF challenge`_

So far this year have been quite fruitful for me in terms of personal growth and experience. Looking forward to another year of growth and learning.
My biggest takeaway for year 2020 was to gave myself another chance and explore a new OS, mainly FreeBSD. I really like everything about it. I think
it is a fairly stable OS. Cheers, have a happy new year.

During my few months of internship, one of the few projects that I have worked on is helping to build a web frontend tools for annotators to annotate image and checkers to check if the annotators have labelled these images correctly. For this project, I am exposed to the Bootstrap_ and JQuery_ framework for the front-end as well as Flask_ for the back-end. I have always disliked developing stuff for the web because I feel that the web is too fast paced.

Bootstrap and Jquery used to be popular frameworks and is still widely used in some projects. I think it is a good starting point as it allows me to quickly create the whole web feel within a week.

This is the first time I understand how the web works and how a web server works. Flask is an interesting framework to learn and after learning Flask, I finally got a greater understanding about web servers and what Diango really is. Django is similar but have more functionality.

Also previously I was exposed to this tool called Postman_, I used something similar called Insomnia_ to send GET/POST request to the Flask server to test the server's functionality.

As for the database side, I felt that learning mySQL in my school have really been useful because it was very important when developing apps for the web. Developing a good database is a good way to ensure that the app scales properly. At the work here, I am exposed to mySQL as well as MongoDB which is actually a NoSQL paradigm, which I think have it's uses for large applications.

A few days ago, I came across a post_ on RedMart and it is a really interesting programming puzzle. The puzzle itself is interesting however
what I thought was fascinating was the fact that the solution to the puzzle would be an actual email link for you to send your cv or even
the solutions to the puzzle.

By the way, one can easily find dozens of solutions by googling the redmart skiing problem. I tried writing the solution in C++ and I ran
into some nasty bugs, I have written a simple generator that generates random grid for me to test. I would not be providing answers since
one can readily run one of the posted solutions online. 

I just want to say this is one of the most creative way to hire someone. I think this is possible for a startup where they have the flexibility
and freedom to do this. Good luck and have fun.

It's been a while since my last blog post. The other day, I suddenly had an idea that struck me and I thought I would like to
turn this idea into a game. So the game I want to make next is this. It is bascially a game about making choices and how sometimes
we do not obey the choices we make. I was thinking about how people always go back on their words when they promise to something
and I thought why not make a game about that.

The basic idea of the game is simple, it will start with a yes/no choice question. For example, do you like candies? If the player
answers yes, I will present a scenario that player will have to throw the candies away rather than keeping them and likewise for the
other choice. This way, when the game ends, I will show remind the player that the (original) choice they had make and the (actual) choice
that they executed is different. 

I just want to show people that people usually promise things and not follow through. We are always fickle minded and we don't always
know what we want.

This would be the game idea for now. Until next time.
